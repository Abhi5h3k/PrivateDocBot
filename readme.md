### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.11.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip 23.2.1
- To utilize the online database, you can simply comment out the line `database = "local"` in the `config.toml` file. This will ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.
- Please note that for the local mode, a functional Node.js installation is essential as it relies on the Prisma CLI for its operation. You can find more details about setting up local persistence in the [Chainlit documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io/cloud/persistence/local).


## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project repository using Git.
2. Download the necessary model from HuggingFace by visiting the following link: [Download Llama Model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin). Once downloaded, move the model file to the "models" directory.
    - also tested with ```llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin``` 
    - [Models](models/models.md)
3.  Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Place your PDF document in the "data" directory. You can choose the appropriate document loader from the available options to match your requirements. Refer to [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) for more information. Note that the current implementation is designed for PDF documents. 
 
5. Launch the application using the following command:
```chainlit run main.py -w```
6. For the initial setup, it's essential to build the vector database. Click on the "Rebuild vector" to initiate this process.

## Note:
Inference speed will depend upon CPU cores and avaialble RAM. It's recomended to have multi core CPU (Laptop / PC) with atleast 16GB RAM. You can deploy it on Server for better performance.

Tested on : 
+ Windows 10
+ i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz 
+ cores : 4
+ RAM : 16GB

## Future Scope:
+ Try adding memory
+ Increase performance by using https://www.ray.io/ or something similar
+ Upgrade to low latency Vector DB
+ Add caching
